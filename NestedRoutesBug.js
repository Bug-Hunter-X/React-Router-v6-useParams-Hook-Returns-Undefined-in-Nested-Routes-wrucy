In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when using nested routes and the `useParams` hook.  If you have a route like `/users/:userId/profile`, and you attempt to access `params.userId` before the route has fully resolved, you'll encounter an error because `params` will initially be `undefined`. This often happens inside a component that's rendered conditionally based on the route's match.
